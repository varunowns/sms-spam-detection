# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning–based SMS Spam Detection system developed using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The system classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Spam messages are a common problem in communication systems.  
This project aims to automatically detect spam SMS messages using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and a machine learning classification model.

---

## ✨ Features
- Text preprocessing using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classification model
- Model evaluation using accuracy score and classification report
- Real-time message prediction using user input

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Working Methodology
1. Load and clean the SMS dataset  
2. Preprocess text using NLP techniques  
3. Convert text data into numerical form using TF-IDF  
4. Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier  
5. Evaluate the model using test data  
6. Predict spam or ham messages using custom user input

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Step 2: Run the Python script
```bash
python spam_detection.py
```

### Step 3: Test the model
- Enter an SMS message when prompted
- The model will predict whether the message is **Spam** or **Ham**

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses a publicly available SMS spam dataset for training and testing purposes.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score is calculated on the test dataset
- Classification report includes precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals  
- Practical use of TF-IDF vectorization  
- Implementation of a Machine Learning classification model  
- Improved Python programming and data preprocessing skills
